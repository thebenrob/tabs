[Verse 1]
C
Run out of words to say
 
You're broken down and tired
E
 I know this world can make
 
Usâ€…feel so small sometimes
     Am
It's hard to know
          F
Where the right way goes
C
 Remember yesterday
 
You're trying to find that fighter
E
 Who pushed through all the pain
 
But now can't find their fire
Am
Deep inside
             F
It's time to come alive
 
 
[Chorus]
    C
And come back like the sun breaks the day
             G
It's time to come back without being afraid
           Am                               F
We need to come back stronger than we were before
 
 
[Verse 2]
C
When it gets hard to breathe
 
You don't know how to hide it
E
 You lost what you believe
 
You don't know how to find it
Am
Don't let go
        F
Of everything you know
C
 We'll make the mountains shake
 
We'll watch them as they crumble
E
 Promise to always stay
 
In case you ever stumble
Am
Trace your steps
             F
And get back up again
 
 
[Chorus]
    C
And come back like the sun breaks the day
             G
It's time to come back without being afraid
           Am                               F
We need to come back stronger than we were before
    C
And come back like the stars in the sky
             G
It's time to come back, no matter the price
           Am                               F
We need to come back stronger than we were before
 
 
[Bridge]

 What you waiting
 
What you waiting
                  Am
What you waiting for?
 
Woah-woah-oh

What you waiting
                  C
What you waiting for?
 
Woah-woah-oh

 What you waiting
 
What you waiting
                  Am
What you waiting for?

 What you waiting for?
 
 
[Chorus]
C
Come back like the sun breaks the day
             G
It's time to come back without being afraid
           Am                               F
We need to come back stronger than we were before
    C
And come back like the stars in the sky
           G
We need to come back, no matter the price
           Am                               F
We need to come back stronger than we were before
 
 
[Outro]
C
 Woah-woah-oh

What you waiting
                   Am
What you waiting for?
 
Woah-woah-oh
F
 What you waiting
 
What you waiting
                    C
What you waiting for?
