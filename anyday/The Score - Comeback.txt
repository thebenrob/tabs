Comeback - The Score
--

[Verse 1]
C
Run out of words to say, you're broken down and tired
Em
I know this world can make usâ€…feel so small sometimes
     Am                      F
It's hard to know, where the right way goes
C
Remember yesterday, you're trying to find that fighter
Em
Who pushed through all the pain, but now can't find their fire
Am                        F
Deep inside, it's time to come alive

[Chorus]
    C
And come back like the sun breaks the day
             G
It's time to come back without being afraid
           Am                              Fm
We need to come back stronger than we were before


[Verse 2]
C
When it gets hard to breathe, you don't know how to hide it
Em
You lost what you believe, you don't know how to find it
Am                    F
Don't let go, of everything you know
C
We'll make the mountains shake, we'll watch them as they crumble
E
Promise to always stay, in case you ever stumble
Am                             F
Trace your steps, and get back up again


[Chorus]
    C
And come back like the sun breaks the day
             G
It's time to come back without being afraid
           Am                              Fm
We need to come back stronger than we were before
    C
And come back like the stars in the sky
             G
It's time to come back, no matter the price
           Am                               Fm
We need to come back stronger than we were before


[Bridge]
C
G                                                    Am
What you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for?
Woah-woah-oh
F                                                    C
What you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for?
Woah-woah-oh
G                                                    Am
What you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for?
F
What you waiting for?


[Chorus]
C
Come back like the sun breaks the day
             G
It's time to come back without being afraid
           Am                              Fm
We need to come back stronger than we were before
    C
And come back like the stars in the sky
           G
We need to come back, no matter the price
           Am                              Fm
We need to come back stronger than we were before


[Outro]
C
Woah-woah-oh
G                                                    Am
What you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for?
Woah-woah-oh
F                                                    C
What you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for?
