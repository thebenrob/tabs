[Intro] C Am G F (x2)


[Verse 1]

       C                 Am
When I talk about it, it carries on 
    G            F
For reasons only knew 
       C              Am
When I talk about it, Aries or 
G              F
Treasons all renew 


[Chorus]

   E           F
Big Me to talk about it 
    C                   C7
I could stand to prove  
  E             F
If we can get around it 
      F                 G     
I'll know that it's true 


[Verse 2]

            C                     Am
When I talk about it, it carries on 
         G               F
For reasons only knew 
            C   G    F    C        G
But it's you I fell in to 

            C                     Am
When I talk about it, it carries on 
          G               F
For reasons only knew 
            C                     Am
When I talk about it, the aries or 
    G              F
Treasons all renew


[Chorus]

   E           F
Big Me to talk about it 
    C                   C7
I could stand to prove  
  E             F
If we can get around it 
      F                 G     
I'll know that it's true 


[Verse 3]

           C                     Am
Well I talked about it, carries on 
    G               F
Never was it true 
            C   G    F    C        G
But it's you I fell in to 

            C                     Am
Well I talked about it, carries on 
    G               F
Never was it true 
            C   G    F    C    
But it's you I fell in to 
G  F    C    C7
I fell in to (x2)
