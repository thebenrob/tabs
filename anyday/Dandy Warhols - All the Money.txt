[Verse 1]
           B                                                A               E
Well I can tell you for the money, the simple life honey is good.  Uh-huh.
            B                                              A           E
Well if you ask me how you made it, secure life, baby, you should, oh, yes you should.
                B                                                 A                           E
Cause if you're doing all the best that you can, but you're still runnin' just as fast as the man says,
           B                                                A        E
Well I can tell you for the money, the simple life honey is good, Uh-huh, now, yes it's good.

[Verse 2]
Now when you're movin' to the city, you worry on your mental health.  Yes you do, now.
Oh, you gentlemen and ladies you've got to be good to yourself. Mm.
So get yourself into a ranch-style home when the neighbor's never more than a stone's throw
Well I can tell you for the money, the simple life honey is good, yes it is, yes it's good.

[Bridge]
D                       B`                      
    But, oh no, all the money,
          D                      B`
still you just can't please everybody.
D                  B`
How bad do, do you want it?
E`                           F#
Cause the money, it looks so good, good, good.

Oh! Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!

[Verse 3]
So now you're chasin' the American dream, Just like the dollar's gonna make everybody scream
But I can tell you for the money the simple life sure looks good. That's right, now, yes it's good.

[Bridge 2]
Oh, no! All the money
looks so good, good, good to everybody.
How bad do, do you want it?
Cause the money, it looks so good, good, good.

[Verse 4]
Now there's a whole lot of faking, and takin', and shakin' my hand
And when they tell you they love ya, they love ya like a one night stand. Mmhmm.
So if you're playin' in a rock and roll band, but still you're doing whatever the man says
Well I can tell you for the money, the simple life honey is good. That's right.  Yes it's good.
