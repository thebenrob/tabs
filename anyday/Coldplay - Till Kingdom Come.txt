C5    C/D  C/E            C/D   C5

Still my   heart and hold my    tongue

Let me   in, unlock the door

[Bridge]



        Am          F5      C5

And the wheels just keep on turning

    Am           F5      C5

The drummer be - gins to drum

        Am         F5      C5

I don’t know which way I’m going

        Am         F5       C5

I don’t know which way I’ve come

Until my day, my day is done

And say you'll come and set me free

                C/G(2)   F5/D             C5

Just say you'll wait,     you'll wait for me

In your tears and in your blood

In your fire and in your flood
