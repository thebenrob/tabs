Better Days - Goo Goo Dolls
--

Capo on 2


          C
And you ask me what I want this year
      F
And I try to make this kind and clear
         G                                  C
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days
      C
Cuz I don't need boxes wrapped in strings
      F
And desire and love and empty things
         G                                  C
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days
 
 
[Chorus]
      F
So take these words
      G
And sing out loud
      F            G
Cuz everyone is forgiven now
      Am                      F            C           C
Cuz tonight's the night the world begins again
 
 
[Verse 2]
            C
And it's someplace simple where we could live
       F
And something only you can give
           G                                     C
And thats faith and trust and peace while we're alive
         C
And the one poor child that saved this world
            F
And there's 10 million more who probably could
       G                                       C
If we all just stopped and said a prayer for them
 
 
[Chorus]
      F
So take these words
      G
And sing out loud
      F            G
Cuz everyone is forgiven now
      Am                      F            C           C
Cuz tonight's the night the world begins again
 
 
[Solo]
C    F    Am   F   C
 
 
[Bridge]
          C
I wish everyone was loved tonight
       F
And somehow stop this endless fight
          G                F                 C
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days
 

[Chorus]
      F
So take these words
      G
And sing out loud
      F            G
Cuz everyone is forgiven now
      Am                      F            C           C
Cuz tonight's the night the world begins again
 
           Am                 F           C
Cuz tonight's the night the world begins again
