[Verse 1]

    ​	  E 				 A			     F#			    B
Brightly beams our Father's mercy, from his lighthouse evermore,
    ​	E			    A			   E	   B		E
but to us he gives the keeping of the lights along the shore


[Verse 2]

    ​	  E 			   A			      F#			B
Dark the night of sin has settled.  Loud the angry billows roar.
    ​  E			      A			      E		  B		   E
Eager eyes are watching, longing for the lights along the shore.


[Verse 3]

    ​	   E 			   A			       F#			  B
Trim your feeble lamp, my brother.  Some poor sailor tempest tossed
    ​	E			    A			   E		B	   E
Trying now to make the harbor, in the darkness may be lost


[Chorus]

    ​	 A			     E 				  F#			   B
Let the lower lights be burning.  Send a gleam across the waves.
          E				       A			  E		  B		  E
Some poor fainting, struggling seaman you may rescue, you may save.
