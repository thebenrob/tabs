[Verse 2]

Here I raise mine Ebenezer; hither by thy help I'm come; 
and I hope, by thy good pleasure, safely to arrive at home. 
Jesus sought me when a stranger, wandering from the fold of God; 
He, to rescue me from danger, interposed his precious blood. 

[Verse 3]
O to grace how great a debtor daily I'm constrained to be! 
Let thy goodness, like a fetter, bind my wandering heart to thee. 
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, prone to leave the God I love; 
here's my heart, O take and seal it, seal it for thy courts above.
