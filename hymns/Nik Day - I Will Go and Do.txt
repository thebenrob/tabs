[Verse 1]
C                    Em
 No matter where I go, I know I'm not alone
Am                        F
 I feel my Savior there beside me.
C                             Em
 He leads me through the night, He's always been my guide,
Am                        F
 He promised he will never leave me
          Dm                      C           G
Though my burdens seem to much to bear, He'll bless me,
Dm             F
So whatever he commands
 
 
[Chorus]
              C                    Em
I will go and do, I will stand for truth
                     Am                          F
Though the world may back away, I will walk right through
            C                         Em
I know if I follow Him, follow Him in faith,
                Am                         F
He will ease my burdens and He'll provide a way
                C      Em
He'll provide a way
 
 
[Verse 2]
C                     Em
 When I feel overcome, and all my strength is gone,
Am                            F
 I think of all the ways He's blessed me.
C                         Em
 My journey may seem long, but He'll lift me with His love,
Am                           F
 A perfect love that's never ending.
             Dm                   C           G
He will give me, give me all the strength I'm needing,
Dm               F
So whatever He commands
 
 
[Chorus]
              C                    Em
I will go and do, I will stand for truth
                     Am                          F
Though the world may back away, I will walk right through
            C                         Em
I know if I follow Him, follow Him in faith,
                Am                         F
He will ease my burdens and He'll provide a way
                G
He'll provide a way
 
 
[Bridge]
                    Am                         G
For me to cross the desert, to sail across the ocean
                   C                        F
If that's where he sends me I'll follow His plan.
                      G
I'll do whatever he commands me,
                           Dm          F        G
For I know that he will lead me to the promised land.
 
 
 
[Chorus]
              C                    Em
I will go and do, I will stand for truth
                     Am                           F
Though the world may shut him out, I will make him room
            C                         Em
I know if I follow Him, follow Him in faith
                Am                         F
He will ease my burdens and He'll provide a way
                C      Em
He'll provide a way...aay
              Am        F
He'll provide a way a-a-a-a-a-ay
 
 
[Outro]
C                    Em
 No matter where I go, I know I'm not alone
Am                        F
 I feel my Savior there beside me.
