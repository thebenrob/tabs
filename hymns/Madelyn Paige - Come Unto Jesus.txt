[Verse 1]
           G              D
Come unto Jesus, ye heavy laden
              C                Cadd9
Care-worn and fainting, by sin oppressed.
             G                   D
He'll safely guide you unto that haven
              C                G
Where all who trust in him may rest.
 
[Verse 2]
           G                D
Come unto Jesus; He'll ever heed you,
              C                    Cadd9
Though in the darkness you've gone astray.
              G                   D
His love will find you and gently lead you
             C          G
From darkest night into day
 
[Chorus]
          C                    G   D
Come unto Jesus, plead for his love
              C                      D
And know that angels are near you up above.
 
[Verse 3]
          G                D
Come unto Jesus from ev'ry nation
           C                    Cadd9
From ev'ry land and isle of the sea.
         G                 D
Unto the high and lowly in station
        C                 G
Ever he calls, "Come unto me."
 
[Chorus]
          C                    G   D
Come unto Jesus, plead for his love
              C                      D
And know that angels are near you up above.
 
[Verse 4]
          G               D
Come unto Jesus, ye heavy laden
              C                Cadd9
Care-worn and fainting, by sin oppressed.
             G                   D
He'll safely guide you unto that haven
              C
Where all who trust him
              Cadd9
Where all who trust him
              C        D       G
Where all who trust in him may rest.
