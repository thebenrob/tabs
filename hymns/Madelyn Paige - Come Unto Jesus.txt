[Verse 1]
           E              B
Come unto Jesus, ye heavy laden
              A                 Aadd9
Care-worn and fainting, by sin oppressed.
             E                   B
He'll safely guide you unto that haven
              A                 E
Where all who trust in him may rest.
 
[Verse 2]
           E                B
Come unto Jesus; He'll ever heed you,
              A                     Aadd9
Though in the darkness you've gone astray.
              E                   B
His love will find you and gently lead you
             A           E
From darkest night into day

[Chorus]
          A                    E
Come unto Jesus, plead for his love
              A                       B
And know that angels are near you up above.

[Verse 3]
          E                B
Come unto Jesus from every nation
           A                     Aadd9
From every land and isle of the sea.
         E                 B
Unto the high and lowly in station
        A                  E
Ever he calls, "Come unto me."

[Chorus]
          A                    E
Come unto Jesus, plead for his love
              A                       B
And know that angels are near you up above.

[Verse 4]
          E               B
Come unto Jesus, ye heavy laden
              A                 Aadd9
Care-worn and fainting, by sin oppressed.
             E                   B
He'll safely guide you unto that haven
              C
Where all who trust him
              Aadd9
Where all who trust him
              A         B        E
Where all who trust in him may rest.
