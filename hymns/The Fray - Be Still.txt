   G         D         Am       Em       G         D         C    G
Be still and know that I'm with you.  Be still and know that I am here.
   G         D         Am       Em       G         D          G

When darkness comes upon you and covers you with fear and shame
   G         D         Am       Em      G      D        G
Be still and know that I'm with you and I will say your name

If terror falls upon your bed and sleep no longer comes,
  G      D       Am      Em        G         D          G
Remember all the words I said, "Be still, be still, and know"

         G      D           Am Em          G      D          C        G
And when you go through the valley and the shadow comes down from the hill,
   G       D     Am       Em     G         D         G
If morning never comes to be, be still, be still, be still

[Bridge 2]

   C              Em            G                   D
If you forget the way to go and lose where you came from
   G         D          Am   Em   G            D      G
If no one is standing beside you, be still and know I am

[Outro]
   G         D         Am       Em      G         D      G
Be still and know that I'm with you, be still and know I am
